Checkpoint for the class.

Contains all the functions I have been created and the most recent version of the class as of 16/04/2024. It now allows to run simulations in parallel. 
You may find examples to run in the file simu_examples.py and an example of analysis for the output of those runs in analysis_examples.py . You only need to uncomment the example you wish to run and change the directory path.
